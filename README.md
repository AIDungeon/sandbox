# Sandbox
The sandbox is used as a simple environment that is set up for developers to start up a small react project easily. Please do not make any changes on this repo unless it will be a default for the sandbox. If interviewing please make a fork of the repo and create a branch, create a pull request when finished and please avoid squashing your commits. 

## Requirements
1. Before you run anything in sandbox be sure that you already have [node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your system.
2. Make sure you have an editor ready for Javascript development. We primarily use VSCode, but as long as your IDE has good JS support you should be ready!

## Getting started
Take the following steps to get the app running on your local machine.

* Once you have cloned the repo, navigate to the `sandbox` folder.
* Create a new branch by running `git checkout -b <your name>`
* Next run the `npm install -g expo-cli` command
* Then run `npm install` to install the packages for the app
* From here you should be able to run `npm run start` to start the app
* We recommend using the browser for testing your expo App, press `w` in the terminal to open load the browser version. (Optionally you can test the app on mobile)

## Tips
* Remember to use small commits `git add *; git commit -m "<your commit message>"; git push`

The expo app will open in a browser where you can test the app either in mobile or in your browser of choice.
