# Tic Tac Toe Kata
Tic tac toe is a fun simple puzzle game played by two players. The game is played on an empty 3x3 grid. Each player takes turns to place their marker (either an X or an O) in an empty cell on the board. The first player to get three of their markers in a straight line in any direction wins. If all cells on the grid are filled and no player has a straight line of three markers then the game is a draw. For more information on the game you can follow this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).
